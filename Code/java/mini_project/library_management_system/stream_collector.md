### Method Overview

```java
public List<Book> searchBooks(String query) {
    // ... method body ...
}
```

This method is designed to search for `Book` objects in a collection (presumably a list) based on a given search query. It returns a list of books that match the search criteria.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Method Signature**:
   ```java
   public List<Book> searchBooks(String query)
   ```
   - **`public`**: The method is accessible from other classes.
   - **`List<Book>`**: The return type is a list of `Book` objects.
   - **`searchBooks(String query)`**: The method takes one parameter, `query`, which is a `String` that represents the search term.

2. **Stream Creation**:
   ```java
   return books.stream()
   ```
   - **`books`**: This is likely a class member variable (e.g., a `List<Book>`) that holds all the books.
   - **`.stream()`**: This method call converts the `List<Book>` into a `Stream<Book>`. A stream is a sequence of elements that supports various operations for processing them (like filtering, mapping, etc.). 

3. **Filtering**:
   ```java
   .filter(book -> 
   ```
   - **`.filter(...)`**: This method takes a `Predicate<Book>` (a functional interface that represents a condition that returns a boolean value) and processes each `book` in the stream, retaining only those that match the condition specified in the predicate.
   - The lambda expression `book -> ...` is the predicate that defines the filtering condition.
   - The `.filter()` method with the lambda expression `book -> book.getTitle().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase())` is conceptually similar to a `for-each` loop in that it applies the specified condition to each element in the stream.

   Inside the lambda, we have the following conditions:
   ```java
   book.getTitle().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()) || 
   book.getAuthor().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()) ||
   book.getISBN().contains(query)
   ```
   - **`book.getTitle().toLowerCase()`**: Retrieves the title of the book and converts it to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive.
   - **`.contains(query.toLowerCase())`**: Checks if the title contains the search query (also converted to lowercase). This ensures that the search is not case-sensitive.
   - **`||` (logical OR)**: The use of logical OR means that if any of the conditions are true, the book will be retained in the stream.
   - The same logic is applied to `book.getAuthor()` and `book.getISBN()`, with the title and author being case-insensitive and the ISBN being case-sensitive.
   - So, every time the filter method processes a Book, it's essentially doing something like this under the hood:
```java
Predicate<Book> predicate = book -> /* your condition */;
boolean matches = predicate.test(item); // This is what's happening implicitly
```

Another way to see it as follows: 

```java
Predicate<Book> matchesQuery = book ->
   book.getTitle().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()) ||
   book.getAuthor().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()) ||
   book.getISBN().contains(query);

return books.stream()
            .filter(matchesQuery)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

4. **Collecting Results**:
   ```java
   .collect(Collectors.toList());
   ```
   - **`.collect(...)`**: This terminal operation transforms the elements in the stream into a different form. In this case, it collects them back into a list.
   - **`Collectors.toList()`**: This is a static method from the `Collectors` utility class that returns a collector which accumulates the input elements into a new `List`. 

5. **Return Statement**:
   The entire line within the method returns the filtered list of books directly:
   ```java
   return books.stream()
               .filter(...) // filtering logic
               .collect(Collectors.toList()); // collecting results into a List
   ```

### Flow of Execution

```java
List<Book> books = ...; // Assume this is a list of Book objects
String query = "example";

List<Book> filteredBooks = books.stream()
    .filter(book -> book.getTitle().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Stream Creation**:
   - You call `books.stream()`, which converts the `List<Book>` into a `Stream<Book>`. This allows you to perform operations on each book.

2. **Calling `filter`**:
   - You use the `filter` method, which takes a predicate (a function that returns true or false). Here, the lambda expression is `book -> book.getTitle().toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase())`.

3. **Lambda Expression**:
   - This lambda defines how to test each book: it checks if the title (converted to lowercase) contains the query (also converted to lowercase).

4. **Iteration and Filtering**:
   - The `filter` method processes each book in the stream:
     - **First Book**: Assume the title is "Example Book".
       - `book.getTitle().toLowerCase()` returns "example book".
       - `contains("example")` returns `true`, so this book is included in the filtered stream.
     - **Second Book**: Title is "Another Book".
       - `book.getTitle().toLowerCase()` returns "another book".
       - `contains("example")` returns `false`, so this book is excluded.
     - **Third Book**: Title is "Sample Example".
       - `book.getTitle().toLowerCase()` returns "sample example".
       - `contains("example")` returns `true`, so this book is included.

5. **Collecting Results**:
   - After filtering, the remaining books in the stream are collected back into a list using `collect(Collectors.toList())`.

6. **Completion**:
   - `filteredBooks` now contains only the books whose titles matched the query.
