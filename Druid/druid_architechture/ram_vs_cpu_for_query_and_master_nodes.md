CPU vs RAM requirements between different components of Apache Druid

## **Query Nodes (Broker, Historical, and Real-time Tasks)**
   - **Broker Service**:
     - **CPU Intensive**: Brokers route queries to the appropriate Historical or Real-time nodes and merge partial results from those nodes. This merging process, especially for large datasets, can be CPU intensive, as it involves combining data from multiple segments, filtering, and aggregating the results.
     - **RAM Intensive**: Brokers also require RAM to hold query context and intermediary results. However, the Broker service is more dependent on CPU than on RAM compared to Historical nodes.
   
   - **Historical Service**:
     - **RAM Intensive**: Historical nodes load segments from deep storage into memory-mapped files. Druid uses memory-mapping to allow these segments to be quickly accessed without using too much heap space. However, when segments are frequently queried or larger segments are loaded, more RAM is used to keep these segments accessible. The more queries the Historical nodes handle, the more RAM is required for efficient segment caching and query processing.
     - **CPU Intensive**: Processing queries (especially complex aggregations and scans) can also be CPU intensive, but the Historical nodes are typically more limited by available RAM because they need to handle large data volumes.

   - **Real-time Tasks (MiddleManager/Indexer)**:
     - **RAM Intensive**: Real-time tasks need RAM to hold in-memory data before it is persisted. These tasks use memory to buffer data before it’s indexed and stored. The more data you ingest in real-time, the more memory you’ll need.
     - **CPU Intensive**: They also require CPU for data ingestion, parsing, and indexing, but the memory requirement is generally more pronounced due to the in-memory processing of incoming data.

## **Coordination Nodes (Coordinator and Overlord)**
   - **Coordinator Service**:
     - **RAM Intensive**: The Coordinator service handles metadata management and the distribution of segments across Historical nodes. It needs enough memory to manage the cluster's metadata efficiently, especially in large clusters with many segments.
     - **CPU Usage**: Coordinator tasks are generally less CPU-intensive because they focus on administrative tasks like segment management and balancing.

   - **Overlord Service**:
     - **CPU Intensive**: The Overlord is responsible for managing and assigning ingestion tasks. While not as CPU-intensive as query processing services, managing and scheduling tasks, especially in large clusters with many ingestion tasks, can use significant CPU.
     - **RAM Usage**: Similar to the Coordinator, the Overlord doesn’t need as much RAM as other services because its tasks are mainly administrative.

## Summary:
- **CPU Intensive**: Broker service (for query processing) and Real-time tasks (during ingestion).
- **RAM Intensive**: Historical service (for memory-mapped segments) and Real-time tasks (for in-memory data before persistence).

**Why?**
- The **Broker** is CPU intensive because of the overhead of merging results and routing queries.
- The **Historical nodes** and **Real-time tasks** are RAM intensive due to their need to keep large datasets in memory or memory-mapped files to efficiently process queries or buffer real-time data.

Choosing the right balance of CPU and RAM across these services depends on the specific workload and query patterns in your Druid cluster.
