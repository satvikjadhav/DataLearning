When we set up an ingestion task in Apache Druid by sending a request to the Router, several components are involved in processing that request. Here's a typical sequence of events:

1. Router:
The ingestion task request first hits the Router. The Router acts as the gateway for external requests and performs initial request handling.

2. Broker:
The Router typically forwards the ingestion task request to a Broker. The Broker is responsible for understanding and coordinating complex requests.

3. Overlord:
The Broker sends the ingestion task to the Overlord. The Overlord is the master node that manages the assignment of tasks to Middle Managers.

4. Middle Manager:
The Overlord assigns the ingestion task to one or more Middle Managers. Middle Managers are the worker nodes that actually execute tasks.

5. Peon:
Within each Middle Manager, a JVM process called a Peon is started to run the ingestion task. The Peon does the actual work of ingesting the data.

6. Deep Storage:
As data is ingested, it's written to Deep Storage (like HDFS, S3, etc.) for permanent backup.

7. Historical Nodes:
Once ingestion is complete, the data becomes available on Historical nodes for querying.

8. Coordinator:
The Coordinator manages the configuration and loading of data segments onto Historical nodes.

Request Flow:

The ingestion request itself doesn't typically go through ZooKeeper. Instead, it flows directly between Druid components as described in the previous response (Router -> Broker -> Overlord -> Middle Manager -> Peon).

Example in Ingestion Process:
During an ingestion task:

- The Overlord might use ZooKeeper to find available Middle Managers.
- The Overlord would update the task status in ZooKeeper.
- Middle Managers would report task progress back to the Overlord, which might then update this information in ZooKeeper.

This is a simplified overview of the process. The actual flow can be more complex depending on the specific configuration, type of ingestion (batch vs streaming), and other factors.
