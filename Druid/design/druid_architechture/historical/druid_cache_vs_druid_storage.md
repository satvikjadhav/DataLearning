In Apache Druid, the properties `druid.segmentCache.locations` and `druid.storage.storageDirectory` serve different purposes related to segment storage and management. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. `druid.segmentCache.locations`
- **Purpose**: This property specifies the directories where the Druid Historical node stores segment data locally after it has been loaded from deep storage.
- **Usage**: The `druid.segmentCache.locations` is a list of locations (directories) on the Historical node where segments are cached. Each entry in this list can specify a path and the maximum size of the cache at that path.
- **Example**: 
  ```json
  druid.segmentCache.locations=[{"path":"/mnt/druid/segment-cache","maxSize":100000000000}]
  ```
  In this example, Druid will store segments in the `/mnt/druid/segment-cache` directory and will cache up to 100 GB of segment data there.

- **Significance**: This property is crucial for performance as it controls where the Historical node keeps the segment files that it actively queries, ensuring fast access.

### 2. `druid.storage.storageDirectory`
- **Purpose**: This property is used to specify the directory where segments are stored on deep storage when using a local filesystem as the deep storage mechanism.
- **Usage**: `druid.storage.storageDirectory` defines the path on the local filesystem that acts as the deep storage location. Segments are first written here by the indexing tasks and then later fetched by Historical nodes.
- **Example**: 
  ```json
  druid.storage.storageDirectory="/mnt/druid/deep-storage"
  ```
  In this example, Druid will store segments in the `/mnt/druid/deep-storage` directory as part of its deep storage.

- **Significance**: This property is significant when Druid is configured to use the local filesystem as deep storage. It is less commonly used in production environments where deep storage is typically on distributed storage like HDFS, S3, or GCS.

### Summary:
- **`druid.segmentCache.locations`**: Specifies where the Historical node caches segments locally for fast access during queries.
- **`druid.storage.storageDirectory`**: Specifies where segments are stored on the local filesystem when using it as deep storage.

In a typical production setup, `druid.storage.storageDirectory` might not be used at all if you are using a cloud-based or distributed storage system, while `druid.segmentCache.locations` is always relevant for the Historical nodes.
